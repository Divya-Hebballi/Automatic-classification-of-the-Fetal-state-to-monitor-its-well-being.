Cardiotocography (CTG) monitoring is one of the popular ways to monitor fetal well-being during pregnancy. The primary purpose of fetal surveillance using CTG is to prevent adverse fetal outcomes. Obstetricians use the data such as fetal heartbeat and uterine contractions to determine if a fetus is pathologic or not. Previously, the obstetricians analyzed the data derived from CTG, which was a waste of time and medical resources. The automatic classification of fetal state can help save obstetricians time and provide information that can help prevent unnecessary C-sections and monitor more efficiently. We have used Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)). In this case, they are specifically devised to classify the Fetal state classes automatically. There are three fetal state classes classified by obstetricians, mainly Normal, Suspect, and Pathologic.
